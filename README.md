# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
This project is an introduction to a larger scale end-to-end analysis project. In this I will get my feet wet, importing data, analyzing, cleaning, transforming and finally QA'ing the data to solve some business questions.

## Process
 1. I started watching videos to understand the import process and the nature of comma seperated flat files. I spent a great deal of time analyzing the data types and how they best suit the  information I had.
 2. Once the data was in the PGadmin project, I began data exploration in order to understand just how dirty the data came in.
 3. The transforming process was tricky as the data was not cleann even after I completed the process and I wanted to pace myself in order to meet the deadline.
 4. Lastly, I used my own research and ideas to formulate questions that I believe add value to the questions.
 5. After which I began thinking about the creative process of quality assurance.

## Results
I discovered through internet research on marketing and ecommerce what some of the terminology in the database meant. From there I began to think about how it could be used. 
I think this type of data is best suited to analyze consumer behavior, popular products in order to maximize sales, high volume periods, and products that just don't work.
I was able to provide some insights, but some I could not quite exactly make use of the data without rigorous cleaning for which I didn't have time on my side. However, I still included the unanswered question(s) as they provide a starting point to look back on as my skills expand.

## Challenges 
* Importing the data: I spent too much time creating the scripts without realizing the data would not fit my constraints. I then had to create everything as a varchar in order to proceed.
* Cleaning the data: Concentrating too much time on a single puzzle piece, I neglected the whole. As I am used to perfectly pristine data this was a wakeup call to the real world.
* Scope: Prioritizing the extent of which to focus on each area
* Technical Difficulties: Crashing on MacOS after OS update
* Confidence: Not having an answer to check to get immediate feedback on a query
* Database design: understanding how to fix PK and FK constraints 

## Future Goals
* Clean the data
* Input sanitation to validate the data before it gets inserted into the DB or flat file
* Have more discussions regarding the project with mentors and classmates to understand the data approaches
* Create some charts and visualizations with Excel from what we learnt in the prep modules
* Properly implement the relationships between tables to generate proper ERD
